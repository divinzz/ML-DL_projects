# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Classifier

This project is a deep learning-powered web app that classifies plant leaf images into different diseases (or healthy) using a trained TensorFlow model. It also provides a confidence score and a detailed description of the disease.

---

## ðŸ“¸ Demo

Upload a plant leaf image and the app will:

- ðŸ§  Predict the disease (e.g., `Tomato___Late_blight`)
- ðŸ“Š Show prediction confidence (e.g., 97.5%)
- ðŸ“– Display a helpful disease description

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/divinzz/ML-DL_projects.git
cd ML-DL_projects/Plant-Disease-Prediction
Install the dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install streamlit tensorflow pillow numpy
Make sure you have these files in the folder:

Untitled6.ipynb (main app code)

plant_disease_model.h5 (the trained model)

class indices.json (label mapping)

Run the app

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run Untitled6.ipynb
ðŸ§  Model Info
