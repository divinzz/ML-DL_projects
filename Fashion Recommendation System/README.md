# 👗 Fashion Recommendation System

The Fashion Recommendation System is a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) application that recommends visually similar fashion items based on a reference image. It leverages deep learning for image feature extraction and computes similarity between images to find the best matches from a fashion dataset.

This project is ideal for use cases such as:
- Online shopping experiences
- Virtual styling assistants
- Personal wardrobe management tools

## 📌 Project Overview

This system processes fashion item images to extract high-dimensional embeddings using a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). These embeddings are used to measure similarity between items. When a user uploads an image, the system compares it against the dataset and displays the top visually similar recommendations.

The project is packaged into a clean web application using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), allowing users to interact with the model in real time.

🧠 How It Works

🖼️ Step 1: Feature Extraction

Uses a pretrained model (e.g., ResNet50 or DenseNet201) from Keras.

Removes the final classification layer to get embeddings from the penultimate layer.

Converts all images into 1D feature vectors.

🔍 Step 2: Similarity Computation

Calculates cosine similarity between the uploaded image and dataset embeddings.

Returns top-N most similar images from the dataset.

🌐 Step 3: Web Interface

Built using Streamlit

User uploads a fashion image

The app displays the top visually similar items

## 📸 Sample Output

Here’s an example of how the app looks when a user uploads a fashion item:

<img width="680" alt="Fashion Recommendation Demo" src="https://your-image-link-here" />

**Recommended Items:**

- Similar shirts, dresses, or styles from the dataset
- Based on visual features (texture, color, pattern)

The system displays the top visually similar images in a horizontal or grid layout.

🔮 Potential Improvements
Use FAISS or Annoy for faster similarity search on large datasets

Add multi-modal filtering (e.g., by color, price, brand)

Train a custom embedding model with contrastive or triplet loss

Integrate user feedback for personalization
